To compare this new data to the baseline data, you must define a target dataset that includes the features you want to analyze for data drift as well as a timestamp field that indicates the point in time when the new data was current -this enables you to measure data drift over temporal intervals. The timestamp can either be a field in the dataset itself, or derived from the folder and filename pattern used to store the data. For example, you might store new data in a folder hierarchy that consists of a folder for the year, containing a folder for the month, which in turn contains a folder for the day; or you might just encode the year, month, and day in the file name like this: *data_2020-01-29.csv*; which is the approach taken in the following code:"
